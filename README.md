# TinyML-enhanced-Multifunctional-Home-Smart-System

Smart Home technology seamlessly integrates various technologies into home networks to enhance the quality of human life. Researchers have been actively exploring the potential of intelligent home technology for over a decade. It represents a convergence of networks, services, and more, aiming to improve the overall living experience. This project introduces a multifunctional smart home system implemented on Arduino Nano 33 BLE, using a machine learning algorithm to interpret user commands for responsive light control. In the event of a fire, the system utilizes a flame sensor to detect it, triggering a buzzer and concurrently sending the user an email notification.

## Data Collection

The dataset contains audio recordings featuring expressions like "lights on," "lights off," and background noise. The data used for the phrases "lights on" and "lights off" were systematically collected from a diverse demographic, including individuals of varied genders, ages, and accents, comprising family members, friends, and university students. Regarding the noise recordings, it was created by imitating noises and recording them, as well as using available noise recordings on YouTube. The temporal duration of the dataset spans 6 minutes and 12 seconds, encompassing a collection of 208 recordings, with 79 recordings for the "lights off" phrase, 77 for "lights on,‚Äù and 52 for background noise.
