# TinyML-enhanced-Multifunctional-Home-Smart-System

Smart Home technology seamlessly integrates various technologies into home networks to enhance the quality of human life. Researchers have been actively exploring the potential of intelligent home technology for over a decade. It represents a convergence of networks, services, and more, aiming to improve the overall living experience. This project introduces a multifunctional smart home system implemented on Arduino Nano 33 BLE, using a machine learning algorithm to interpret user commands for responsive light control. In the event of a fire, the system utilizes a flame sensor to detect it, triggering a buzzer and concurrently sending the user an email notification.
